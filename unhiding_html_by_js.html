<p>You fill my heart with so much love and happiness. It makes me happy to see you smile. I love your laugh, your warm touch, your sweet kisses. I love how you look at me with those beautiful eyes of yours, and I love it when you hold me in your arms when you care for me . This is true i always talk about another boys with you but you don't know the way i connected to you 
    the way i feel for you , the way i love you no other boy can replace your place.
